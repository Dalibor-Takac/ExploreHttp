# ExploreHttp
This is a simple replacement for postman. It is designed to run exclusively on windows and si ment to be signficantly faster then the tool it replaces. Keeping it simple for the time being means I can add functionality later that appears to be needed while keeping the good performance.
# Building
To build this tool, the community edition of VisualStudio 2022 or newer should be sufficient. Clone, open the solution and build.
You might need to install additional workloads in order to start the build. Visual studio should complain if something is missing when you open the solution.
Automated builds are not planned, if you need a secure build for work, build it from source.
